# Chalan Management System

The **Chalan Management System** is a Laravel-based web application designed to manage chalans for educational institutions. This system enables administrators to create, view, and manage chalans for students, while students can view their chalans and make payments. Key features include chalan creation, rules and regulations management, role-based access, and an intuitive dashboard for both administrators and students.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - **Admin**: Can create chalans, view student records, manage rules, and view payment statuses.
  - **Student**: Can view assigned chalans, make payments, and track the status of each payment.

- **Chalan Management**:
  - Create, assign, and view chalans.
  - Track payment proofs for student chalans.
  - Generate a list of students with their assigned chalans, amounts, and payment statuses.

- **Rule Management**:
  - Define and assign rules related to chalan creation.
  - Modify existing rules based on institutional requirements.

- **Payment Proof Upload**:
  - Students can upload proof of payment, which updates the payment status of the chalan.
